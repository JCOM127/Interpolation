Title: "Interpolation Numerical Methods in Python"

Description:
This GitHub repository contains a collection of Python codes showcasing various interpolation numerical methods. These methods leverage popular libraries such as NumPy, SymPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform interpolation tasks efficiently and visualize the results effectively.

Features:
1. Lagrange Interpolation: The code demonstrates the Lagrange interpolation method, which approximates a function using polynomial interpolation. It takes a set of data points, applies the Lagrange polynomial, and evaluates the polynomial at a specified point. The code also includes visualizations to plot the data points and the Lagrange polynomial.

2. Newton Interpolation: This code implements the Newton interpolation method, which interpolates a function using divided differences. It constructs a divided difference table and calculates the coefficients for the Newton polynomial. The code provides a function to evaluate the polynomial at a given point and includes visualizations to display the data points and the interpolated polynomial.

3. Spline Interpolation: The repository includes code for spline interpolation, a method that constructs piecewise polynomials to approximate a function. It utilizes cubic and quadratic spline interpolation techniques to interpolate the data. The code plots the data points, the spline polynomials, and allows customization of the degree of the spline polynomial.

4. Other Libraries: The codes leverage additional libraries such as SymPy for symbolic computation, Pandas for data manipulation, and Seaborn for enhanced data visualization. These libraries enhance the functionalities of the interpolation methods and provide additional flexibility for data analysis and plotting.

Each code file in the repository is accompanied by detailed comments explaining the underlying algorithm and usage of libraries. The codes are well-structured, modular, and follow best practices of Python programming. They can serve as valuable references and starting points for anyone interested in understanding and implementing interpolation numerical methods in Python.
